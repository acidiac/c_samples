 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Write a program to read two integers with the following significance.
 * The first integer value represents a time of day on a 24 hour clock, so that 1245 represents quarter to one mid-day, for example.
 * The second integer represents a time duration in a similar way, so that 345 represents three hours and 45 minutes.
 * This duration is to be added to the first time, and the result printed out in the same notation,
 * in this case 1630 which is the time 3 hours and 45 minutes after 12.45.
 * Typical output might be Start time is 1415. Duration is 50. End time is 1505.
 * There are a few extra marks for spotting. Start time is 2300. Duration is 200. End time is 100.
